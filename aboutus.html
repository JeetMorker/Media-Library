<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p1>An idea we have a for futue releases is an automatic update system that will allow new media to be uploaded automatically instead of manually like we are doing. This would require implementing a database. </p1>

In order to add your changes you must git push them back so everyone else can pull them. We are using html, css, javascript, and firebase database. Also be sure to chmod after changes are made to ensure they show up on the website. </p1>

<p1>The authors for this project are Jeet Morker, Tim Allex, Ryan Lu, and Johnny Lin. We would like to acknowledge our scrum master for helping us as well.</p1>

<h2>Project status</h2>
<p1>After the end of CI 103, we will no longer be working on this project due to lack of time. We are open to contributers continuing it though. </p1>
