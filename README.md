## Description
It is a digital media library that allows users to rate and comment on different forms of media

## Setting up, testing, deploying, and changing the codebase
In order to set up the code base you must git pull to your public html on tux. To test it, you go to the tux link to check the changes on the website. To deploy and change it, you must git pull all changes you made to files and them chmod all changes as well. 

## Dependencies and Integrations
There are no dependencies and integrations with other systems.

## Installation
There is no need to install anything to use this product since it is just a website. In order to access it you need to use the tux link after pulling it into your public.html.

## Usage
This website is used to find and rate different types of media. The homepage will show some popular media and genres and users will be able to click on stars to rate them. The user can then locate our naviagation bar are the top left of the screen to go to the song, movie, or book page. These pages will have a variety of different media. The user can enter a name into the search bar to find a specifc media and can clear the search. They can also sort by many options inlcuding specific genre. They can click the media to view more about it. They will be able to rate and submit a comment on the media as well. 

## Support
In order to ask for help you can contact the following drexel emails: jm5265, ta654, and rl856

## Roadmap
An idea we have a for futue releases is an automatic update system that will allow new media to be uploaded automatically instead of manually like we are doing. This would require implementing a database.

## Contributing
We are open to contributers for making a database for all the media in this website. In order to contribute, you must git clone this project into your tux public.html. In order to add your changes you must git push them back so everyone else can pull them. We are using html, css, javascript, and firebase database. Also be sure to chmod after changes are made to ensure they show up on the website.  

## Authors and acknowledgment
The authors for this project are Jeet Morker, Tim Allex, Ryan Lu, and Johnny Lin. We would like to acknowledge our scrum master for helping us as well.

## Project status
After the end of CI 103, we will no longer be working on this project due to lack of time. We are open to contributers continuing it though.
